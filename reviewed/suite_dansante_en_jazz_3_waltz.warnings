WARNING  ms3.Parse.schulhoff_suite_dansante_en_jazz.suite_dansante_en_jazz_3_waltz
	MC 68 is supposed to jump to label segno but there are 2 of them: [5, 68]. Picking the first one.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 32, '0', 'V7(#119)/vii') ms3.Parse.schulhoff_suite_dansante_en_jazz.suite_dansante_en_jazz_3_waltz
	The label 'V7(#119)/vii' in m. 32, onset 0 (MC 32, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of A.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#4', '#6', '#1', '3') [('D#', 'F##', 'A#', 'C#')] plus the added ('#7', '5') [('G##', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 15 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
